# odin-recipes

## Introduction
This project is a basic recipe website built using HTML. It serves as a practice exercise to reinforce my understanding of HTML fundamentals, including:
- Creating and structuring web pages.
- Using headings, paragraphs, lists, and links.
- Organizing content with semantic HTML elements.
- Building a multi-page website with internal links.

The website consists of a main index page that links to individual recipe pages. While the site is not styled with CSS yet, it demonstrates my ability to create a functional and well-structured HTML-based website.

## Skills Demonstrated
- **HTML Basics**: Proper use of HTML tags (`<html>`, `<head>`, `<body>`, etc.).
- **Text Formatting**: Using headings (`<h1>` to `<h6>`), paragraphs (`<p>`), and lists (`<ul>`, `<ol>`, `<li>`).
- **Links**: Creating internal links (`<a>`) to navigate between pages.
- **Images**: Embedding images (`<img>`) with descriptive `alt` attributes.
- **Semantic HTML**: Using semantic elements like `<header>`, `<main>`, and `<footer>` for better structure and accessibility.

## Project Structure
- **index.html**: The main page with links to individual recipe pages.
- **recipes/**: A directory containing individual recipe pages (e.g., `pasta.html`, `pizza.html`).
- **README.md**: This file, providing an overview of the project.

## Future Improvements
In the future, this project will be revisited to:
- Add CSS for styling and layout.
- Improve responsiveness for different screen sizes.
- Enhance accessibility and user experience.
