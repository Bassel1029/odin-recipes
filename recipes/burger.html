    <h2>Descritpion</h2>
    <p>Burgers are a classic favorite, perfect for a quick and satisfying meal. Start by shaping ground beef into patties and seasoning them with salt and pepper. Cook the patties on a grill or stovetop until they reach your desired level of doneness. While the patties cook, toast the burger buns and prepare your favorite toppings, like lettuce, tomato, onion, pickles, and cheese.</p>
    <p>Assemble your burger by placing the patty on the bottom bun, adding your toppings, and finishing with the top bun. For extra flavor, spread some mayonnaise, ketchup, or mustard on the buns. Serve with a side of fries or a fresh salad for a complete meal. Burgers are customizable, so feel free to get creative with your ingredients!</p>
